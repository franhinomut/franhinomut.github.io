### Facial Verification with a Siamese Network

In this project, I have learnt how to build a deep facial recognition application to authenticate into an application. 
I have started off by building a model using Deep Learning with Tensorflow, which replicates what is shown in the paper titled [Siamese Neural Networks for One-Shot Image Recognition](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf)

### Image Classification using Caltech 101 Dataset

In the first strategy, I use the pre-training with the ImageNet dataset and in the second, we design a neural network from scratch.
